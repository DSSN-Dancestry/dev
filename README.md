## What is Dancestry?
Dancestry is an interactive, web-based network illustrating connections between dance artists, their teachers, their students, their collaborators and people who they were influenced by. The main goal is to establish a knowledge base documenting 20th and 21st century dance that is searchable and minable and that will continue to grow as new generations of artists are added. Dancestry is intended as a global resource for investigating artistic influences, career paths, choreographic connections, and complex and obscure relationships.<br/>
